# MAX_LEN_NO_PATTERN : integer (supposed to be short, around 24)

# 	tuple = DNA sequence of the exact length <guideLen>
# 	isGuider = 0 or 1, 1=Guider, 0=no guider. 
# 	If guider, first advance nt then take key.
# 	ntadvance = nucleotides to advance in the sequence when observing the tuple.
# 		    the minimum advance is 1.
# 	comment is any text until end of line (max 900 chars).

# Next lines start with extension, maxlennopatrn, issym, guidelen
