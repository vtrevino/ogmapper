# FILE CONTENT FORMAT:
# # Has mark optional Comments, as many lines as needed
# # ...
# Extension: 4 letters (not used as only 1 file is now in index)
# MAX_LEN_NO_PATTERN : integer (supposed to be short, around 24)
# isSymmetric : 0=no, 1=yes
# guideLen : size of the guide in nucleotides, integer. All guideLen-combinations are expected
# # Optional Comments, as many lines as needed
# # ...

# ...
# 	tuple = DNA sequence of the exact length <guideLen>
# 	isGuider = 0 or 1, 1=Guider, 0=no guider. 
# 	If guider, first advance nt then take key.
# 	ntadvance = nucleotides to advance in the sequence when observing the tuple.
# 		    the minimum advance is 1.
# 	comment is any text until end of line (max 900 chars).
#
# Next lines start with extension, maxlennopatrn, issym, guidelen
